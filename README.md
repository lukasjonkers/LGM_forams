This repository provides the code used for Jonkers et al. "Strong temperature gradients in the ice age North Atlantic Ocean revealed by plankton biogeography" Nature Geoscience, 2023, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01328-7.

It contains the planktonic foraminifera and temperature (from climatology and simulations) data to reproduce the analyses and figures. The scripts are separated into analysis, functions and figures for easy reference.

Note that the scripts are not optimised in any way, reach out if things don't work.
